# Binding Question

What is bucklescript looking for satisfy the `Functions are not valid as a React child.` error being produced by the following example?

I have this binding to `withAuthenticator` from `aws-amplify-react`.

```reason
[@bs.deriving abstract]
type props = {
  [@bs.as "Comp"]
  comp: React.element,
  [@bs.optional] includeGreetings: bool,
};

[@genType.import ("aws-amplify-react", "withAuthenticator")] [@react.component]
external make:(
    ~props:props,
  ) => React.element = "withAuthenticator";
let default = make;

```

In `Demo.re` I use the binding as follows:

```reason
let props = {
  WithAuthenticator.props(
    ~comp={
      <App />;
    },
    ~includeGreetings=true,
    (),
  );
};
Js.log(props);
[@react.component]
let app = () => <WithAuthenticator props />;
```

Then in `App.js` I use `Demo.re` like so:

```js
import Amplify from 'aws-amplify';
import {app as App } from './Demo.bs';
import awsconfig from './aws-exports';
import './App.css';
Amplify.configure(awsconfig);

export default App;
```

Which produces the following error:

```bsh
 Warning: Functions are not valid as a React child. This may happen if you return a Component instead of <Component /> from render. Or maybe you meant to call this function rather than return it.
    in withAuthenticator (created by Demo$app)
    in Demo$app (at src/index.js:7)
```

I would like to understand what this means in order to deal with when it comes up again.

This is what the compiled bucklescript code is in `Demo.bs.js`:

```js
// Generated by BUCKLESCRIPT, PLEASE EDIT WITH CARE
'use strict';

var React = require("react");
var App$ReactHooksTemplate = require("./App.bs.js");
var WithAuthenticator$ReactHooksTemplate = require("../aws/WithAuthenticator.bs.js");

var props = {
  Comp: React.createElement(App$ReactHooksTemplate.make, { }),
  includeGreetings: true
};

console.log(props);

function Demo$app(Props) {
  return React.createElement(WithAuthenticator$ReactHooksTemplate.make, {
              props: props
            });
}

var app = Demo$app;

exports.props = props;
exports.app = app;
/* props Not a pure module */
```

The binding is working when `App.re` is being passed to `WithAuthenticator.re` when used in `src/js/App.js`.

It doesnt work when call directly in `src/re/Demo.re`. I am trying to understand why and how to fix it. Thanks.

This is App is the demo from the AwsAmplify docs found here: <https://aws-amplify.github.io/docs/js/react.>

Then add run `yarn add bs-platform -D` and `yarn add reason-react`.

Then `touch bsconfig.json` and add following to it.

```json
{
  "name": "react-hooks-template",
  "reason": {
    "react-jsx": 3
  },
  "sources": {
    "dir" : "src",
    "subdirs" : true
  },
  "package-specs": [{
    "module": "commonjs",
    "in-source": true
  }],
  "suffix": ".bs.js",
  "namespace": true,
  "bs-dependencies": [
    "reason-react"
  ],
  "gentypeconfig": {
    "language": "untyped",
    "module": "es6",
    "importPath": "relative",
    "reasonReactPath": "reason-react/src/ReasonReact.js",
    "exportInterfaces": false,
    "shims": {},
    "debug": {
      "all": false,

  },

}
```
